<h1>Hello Coursera! Wassup?</h1>
<h1> 27/12/2021</h1>
<p>Hello, this is the first stage of learning where I learnt to use git to edit code and take it to the online github and make it into a website</p>
<p>I have also learnt what HTML is used for as well as CSS and Javascript. Thos 3 coding languages are used together to build the website page and shape it.</p>
<p>In this page the only language used is HTML and it's use is to give the website it's shape and text and stuff like that...</p>
<p>Okay so I will stop adding to this website until I learn something new to try :)</p>
